x add option to turn off file+line tracking for generated .hh as it
  causes unnecessary recompilation of dependencies (could generate a
  separate map, but would then need editor or compiler to recognise and
  map errors) - note no file+line tracking is defualt .hh

x fix generation of friend functions
  x generate them always inline
  - later split them, but that is perhaps impossible since it
    means re-qualifying param types and it is not possible to tell how much
    to add to each param type?

* no such thing as static var decl, it is a def

- param default values

x static member object:
    static const char* const _user_exns[] = {
      0
    };

- global (variant of above, or same? could just do "object decl") and
  let context show whether it is a class member or global?

x recognise template specialisation class
x split it properly

x recognise template specialisation function
x split it properly

x test-JoiningIterator

x replace xju::Exception with parser specific exception, that
  uses Parser* as context, to defer string creation until exception
  is actually formatted
x defer cause creation, resurrect specific cause strings
x fix string literal parsing:
  x no need to do continuations
  x do it character-based with specials as per c++ standard

- add charLiteral(char) and use it instead of oneOfChars("x")

x make readableRepr smarter to get better error messages, so that
  other tools get the full exception context to work with:
  x only show named parsers, except always show the last parser
    context

- rework atLeastOne for saner error message - see REVISIT in test-parse.cc

- add zeroOrOne (perhaps call it optional?) and review where to use it

- replace more zeroOrMore with parseUntil(match,x)

x get rid of includeAllExceptionContext (make it always true)

x on parse failure, output the branch that got furthest
  x note that only exceptions are xju::Exception thrown explicitly in
    parser.cc/hh
  x replace with Malfomed exception that has at and can carry
    other fail branches

- also to get better errors need to make use of keywords, eg
  if have "class" but what follows is not a class, want that error
  message, not the error message that tries to parse eg function at
  that point. ie fail parseFunction because function cannot start with
  keyword class (or template, namespace, enum etc)
  x try using "longest branch" as error
  - where multiple longest branches, combine their causes
  - combine with prepending ! parseKeyword() to parseFunction
  
- also consider adding lookingAt() to see if that gives better errors

- I -> hcp::I in I.h

- hcp_ast::String -> Tagged..<StringTag>?

- align ast names with C++ standard

- add more profiling, then go back to using throw for exceptions
  and see what the penalty

- function_proto looks like it would be slow as it does a long
  lookahead, is there another way? Might need a hand-coded parser?
  - perhaps commonality between function and object decl? both start
    with type and name? what is difference to function pointer?

x speed parsing by caching results <at,parser> => PV or exception
  stats:

  performance

    ~ group keywords together? That would make it harder to read the
      code
    - create parsers for such keywords as namespace, template, class
      so can cache results
      - bundle them up into parseKeyword, and add a operator!()
        then make parseFunction start with !parseKeyword
       
    x probably slow through use of C++ exceptions, could switch to using
      return types, noting that at the moment we only have a single
      exception type (xju::Exception)... note to support tools eg
      context-at-point we probably need something more sophisticated
      than xju::Exception but worry about that later (actually above
      proposes to replace with Malformed)
      x think just need to redefine Parser methods to throw() and
        return the CachedResult type? Could rename it to ParseResult?
      x perhaps fork a version to test performance difference
branch nothrow, got about 20% better:

    ~ perhaps also look at deferring creation of exception strings until
      actually needed... but first get profiling data, might need to
      parse many times to get decent stats

    x saved lots of time by reworking the -v (includeAllExceptionContext)
      handling, since it was adding and discarding lots of context

    x reworked to defer generating context strings until exception
      printed:

    x above includes all exception detail, except that "or" only keeps
      the term that got furthest, alas the resulting error messages
      are too verbose (see test-parser.cc), ideas:
        - context given for "and" should not go past the term where we
          actually failed
          ~ if exception context was a PR we could dynamically make
            one that included just the relevant part; we could also
            do better with the "or" case
          ~ perhaps revisit which parsers add context, perhaps go back
            to having just named parsers add context; but also keep
            the "leaf" context
    ~ do first pass without creating any exception detail, then
      come back and reparse from where we went wrong in order to get
      exception detail... no don't need that complex, just delay
      string creation, always add context and make readableRepr smart
