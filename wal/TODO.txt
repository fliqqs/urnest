- ditch appengine for python3 httpd
- makeParams:
  cookies from environ('HTTP_COOKIE')
  cookiesHeader()
                  [('Set-Cookie', 'eb_surveyId=%(surveyId)s'%vars()),
                   ('Set-Cookie', 'eb_responseId=%(responseId)s'%vars())]

  get/post:
    if wsgiEnv['REQUEST_METHOD']=='GET':

  vars:
    see eb.Request it looks pretty good


- tests:
  - get with params
  - post with form
    - mime v form encoding?
  - post with file
  
- tests: always have non-ascii chars in them
- how to urlencode such chars correctly?
