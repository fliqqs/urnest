  - add all the assert functions from C++ xju::assert

    https://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-module-system

    It is a clear explanation of Rust's module system, so why is it still
    impossible to second guess?

    One problem is that in the explanation, it shows how to do [A]:
      main.rs =>
      routes/user_route.rs =>
      models/user_model.rs
    ... and it shows how to do [B]:
      main.rs =>
      config.rs
    ... but as soon as I try to do the equivalent one level up [C]:
      main.rs =>
      config.rs =>
      log.rs
    ... um, err, it wants a declaration of log in config.rs, but there
    is nowhere to put it. You'd think that if main.rs declares config
    because it uses config, then config could declare log because it uses log.
    But apparently it can't? Another thought would be to declare it in the
    top-level mod.rs, but that is not read. It turns out that it does
    work if I declare the "transitively required" log module in the
    main.rs, but that goes against the grain somehow, because in the
    other example case [A] the transitively required is declared where it
    is required not somewhere else.

    So then we find https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/path-changes.html, which says:
    
      There's a root cause for why it's so confusing to many: while there are
      simple and consistent rules defining the module system, their
      consequences can feel inconsistent, counterintuitive and mysterious.

    ... which incidentally could be read as "all the users are wrong, what
    I've implemented is right", it just doesn't add up. Really, if the
    simple and consistent rules defining the module system cause such
    confusion, they're probably the wrong rules, throw them out.

    There is another possible root cause: that the simple and consistent
    rules defining the module system are simply and consistently not
    documented. So when I get into the above situation there's no
    description I can follow that allows me to step through as the
    compiler would.


    Like others here I came unstuck with rust modules. I read the nice
    section in the rust book but when I tried to apply what I read there
    I quickly got into trouble and the book didn't seem to help. A web
    search suggested I wasn't the only one to get into trouble, but nothing
    I found gave me the info I needed to see where I was going wrong.
    
    With head scratching and experimentation and re-reading I think I
    see it now so will try to write it down and ask "is this correct?":

      The rust compiler works from a single source file - the "crate root"
      file - and builds something. For example "rustc server.rs" builds an
      executable from the server.rs crate root file.
      
      Rust code in the crate root file can use modules defined elsewhere,
      either "local" modules - defined in other local source files - or
      "external" modules.

      For "external" modules, you tell the compiler what "crates" they are
      in and where to find those crates. ("What" either by "extern crate x;"
      statements in the crate root file or other local source files,
      or implicitly via "use ::" statements. "Where" via compiler options
      -L, --extern).

      "Local" modules must be "introduced" to rustc via "mod" statements.
      Where rustc looks for those modules' source code takes a bit
      of explaining.

      First, the crate root file must explicitly list - i.e. introduce -
      via mod statements all the top level modules that contain local
      code for the run of rustc. By default rustc expects the source code for
      those modules to be in the same directory as the crate root file
      itself, e.g. if we have /x/y/main.rs that says:

         mod fred;

      ... then "rustc /x/y/main.rs" will expect the code for module fred
      to be in /x/y, as either /x/y/fred.rs or the out-of-favour
      /x/y/fred/mod.rs.

      Once we put "mod fred;" in main.rs, main.rs can happily refer to code
      in module fred, e.g. "fred::f1()". Module fred can (and must) introduce
      its child modules via e.g. "mod jude; mod jock;", but cannot introduce
      grand-children or sibling modules:
      
      - only a child module's parent module can introduce siblings of the
      child module; top level modules are not "child modules"

      - only the crate root file can introduce top level modules
      (This can seem anomolous in a sense because my crate root file's top
      level modules can be children - descendants - of another crate root
      file's top level modules.)

      There is another seeming anomoly: a child module
      can "use" ancestors and their siblings and children even though it
      can't introduce them. It's not untill we come across the
      #[path] facility that "limitation" makes sense.

      So what does #[path] do? Well, *by default* rustc expects our top
      level module's source code (e.g. fred.rs) to be in the same directory as
      the crate root file. But the crate root file (and only the crate root
      file) can override that default location using #[path]. For example:
      
        #[path "/somewhere/else/the_real_fred/mod.rs"]
	mod fred;

      ... will make rustc, when looking for fred, ignore the directory of the
      crate root file and use /somewhere/else/the_real_fred/mod.rs as the
      code for fred. rustc also then looks for fred's child modules
      in /somewhere/else, e.g. /somewhere/else/jude.rs and
      /somewhere/else/jock/mod.rs.

      That perhaps reveals why a child module cannot introduce its
      siblings: if rustc allowed it there could be ambiguity over where
      to find that module.

      Note that modules themselves can use #[path] when introducing their
      children.

      There is one more catch:

        #[path fred=/somewhere/else/the_real_fred.rs]
	mod fred;

      ... in my crate root file did not work. I expected it to make
      rustc look for my 2nd level modules in /somewhere/else/the_real_fred/
      but it did not. It insisted that I use:

        #[path fred=/somewhere/else/the_real_fred/mod.rs]
	mod fred;

      This is just be a limitation of the rustc version I was
      using, 1.41.1, in any case it does not inhibit my use of rustc.

      Note also that unlike say python or C++, there are no compiler options
      or environment variables to tell rustc where to find the code for
      local modules.

  Did I get that right? Have I missed anything?
  

      Simple, isn't it?

      Note that the fact that fred.rs cannot introduce
      siblings or ancestors or grand-descendants is
      seemingly never pointed out clearly in the official documentation nor
      (as far as I can find) unofficial how-tos, tutorials, faqs, forums.
      For me this omission caused days of head-scratching and I imagine
      is behind some of the fustrated questions on the net. But rust
      has enough unique valuable features (lifetime checking - one is enough)
      that I will get over it.
