Dion is a compatible* re-implementation of odin (hence the anagram.) to
make code easier to understand and modify.

* possibly excluding cyclic dependency swallowing

This involves:

  - writing in clean C++
  - reduce unnecessary rechecking
  - adding comprehensive unit tests

... hopefully then can improve and extend functionality more easily, e.g.:

  - support "incremental"  derivations
  - better represent directories
