client side:

- can get (CORBA_Object.h class Object) CORBA::Object* from 
  ORB::string_to_object
- then generated code calls CORBA::Object::_PR_getobj()->_realNarrow(
   _PD_repoId), which is just 
    (omniObjRef.h) omniObjRef* CORBA::Object::pd_obj
- ... generated code has a static _pof_F which is a
  proxyObjectFactory and it has a omniObjRef* newObjRef that
  returns a generated class p1::_objref_F : omniObjRef
    which has an implementation of each method


x allow "unchecked narrow"? Na
