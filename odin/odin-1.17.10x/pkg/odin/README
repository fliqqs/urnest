The odin cache (located by $ODIN) is a directory tree containing:

INFO file (if-info.c)
  - database keyed by file offset (Loc/LocHdr/LocElm/LocInp), entries cover:
    - current and verify "dates" (sequence numbers, not calendar dates)
    - tree of source and derived objects, root of tree corresponds to
      file system root (/) and is global RootLocHdr, where derived
      objects are children of the file they are derived from, e.g.
                           "/"                    <--- root
                          /  \
                       "src"  "h"                 <--- real directories
                        /        \
		       /	 / \
                     "x.cc"  "x.hh" "y.hh"        <--- real source files
                     /
               +inc_sp=/h:o                       <-- derived

      ... shows a single derived file in the tree. Each of the above
      objects gets an HdrInf entry in the INFO database and its id (Loc) is
      the offset of that entry within the INFO file.

      The branches in the tree are captured by HdrInf.Son/Brother/Father e.g.:
        "src".Father is "/"
	"h".Son is "x.hh"
	"x.hh".Brother is "y.hh"
      ... i.e. above is more precisely drawn as:
                           "/"
			 Son
			 /
			"src"-Brother-"h"
		       Son           Son
		       /            /
		     "x.cc"      "x.hh"-Brother-"y.hh"
                   Son
		   /
		+inc_sp=/h:o

      Each tree entry has a Status (Status_.h) e.g. OK (e.g. derived
      file built with no warnings), Warning (e.g. dervied file built
      but with warnings), Error (e.g. derived file build failed).

      Each entry keeps "dates" detailing when it was last modified, when
      it was last stat'd/updated etc:
        ModDate - "date" file modified
	VerifyDate - "date" file last verified up to date
	  (v global VerifyDate which is the date we want it to be verified at)
	. REVISIT: what are the dates really?
      
FILES directory
    The content (data) of each derived file like "/src/x.cc+inc_sp=/h:o"
    (that's its full name) is stored in a file within the FILES subdirectory
    tree of the $ODIN cache directory. The file name includes the
    derived file's id (Loc) so that when a derived file is referred
    to by its data file name odin can get its id (Loc) - see
    CacheFileName_LocHdr and CacheFileName_FilHdr . The FILES
    subdirectory tree is multi-level to keep the number of files per
    directory small. The first time a derived object's data file name is
    needed it is assigned to a directory (see DataNum, HdrInf.DataNum and
    FilHdr_DataFileName). A derived file's warnings (and errors), which
    odin persists, sit alongside the data file (see FilHdr_WarningFileName
    and FilHdr_ErrorFileName).


Source and Derived Object Types

  Source File
    - no inputs

  Derived File
    - inputs chained off HdrInf.LocInp
      - is a list of InpInf, each refs a HdrInf via its LocHdr
